# FallingWords

## Simple Falling Words game by matching words of English/Spanish on MVVM Structure

## Technologies I Used

- **Retrofit**
- **RxJava2**
- **LiveData**
- **ViewBinding**
- **Transition Animations**
- **Material Design**

## Time distribution (Total: 8 Hours)

- Planning the development of the application : 30 minutes
- UI (Fragments,Navigation and Nav animations,app icon etc.) : 1 Hour
- Created **Retrofit** and **RxJava**,Getting API response from .json file : 30 minutes
- **ViewModel** functions : 2 hours
- Fragment UI/UX functions : 2 hours
- Trying to implement game logic : 2 hours


## Notes on the development phase

- This was my very first game development process.I had a lot of fun and learned a lot while developing.
- Sometimes I got stuck, but somehow I managed to move forward.
- Once again, I realized how enjoyable it is for a software developer to find solutions by researching and implement them to our code.
- I tried to show every stage of App on Version Control.
- It was really a great journey for me.Thanks for the code challenge!

## Decisions made to solve certain aspects of the game

- This was both the hardest and the most enjoyable part for me.
- Firstly I tried to get data from the API and used logging the API response on LogCat.
- I used **ViewBinding** to display values on screen which are coming from the API.
- I used **AnimationUtils** for the **Falling Spanish Word**
- I used bunch of **ClickListeners** and **NavControllers** on Buttons
- I arranged transition animations between fragments.
- I used **RxJava CompositeDisposable** for the performance and prevent memory leaks.


## Decisions made because of restricted time

- I wanted to use DI for the app but I tought it might be overkill for this project.
- UI could be better but It wasn't most important part of the app.


## If I had more time

- The game is currently not working exactly as requested from me.
- I would try to make the logic of the game work properly
- I would do some unit tests if I had more time.
